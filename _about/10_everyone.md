We want to motivate as many people as possible to join the hacking community. We want to organize an event where young hackers can work on their own pet projects, while experienced hackers can compete for prizes in ambitious categories.

We want to unite participants from all kinds of backgrounds. We want designers, organizers and artists to join the community of hackers and makers. We want people to pour all their creativity into their project in an inspiring environment.
