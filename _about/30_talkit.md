We do the doing, [talKIT](http://talkit.eu/) does the talking. talKIT is an amazing tech conference where people from all kinds of backgrounds come together to discuss one big topic. This year it's the future of transportation, so get pumped!

TalKIT takes a look at this topic from many different angles, not just tech. It's a great experience and tons of fun. However, be aware that the entire talKIT conference is in German, while the hackathon is in English.
