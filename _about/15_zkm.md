The hackathon is hosted at the ZKM. The ZKM is a small media museum that bridges the gap between art, technology and design with its regularly changing, one-of-a-kind exhibits. In its small niche, it has gained global attention. In fact the New York Times dubbed it as “an institution that has no exact parallel in the world and not even a recognizable echo in America."

It provides a unique atmosphere for working and getting inspired. A perfect place for a hackathon.
